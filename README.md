Python required to run the script: https://www.python.org/downloads/

This script is for finding unused Wabbajack mods in a modlist's downloads folder by reading the meta files, and to then move the archives to a folder called Unused Mods. 

If there are unused mods in the downloads folder without meta files, you need to run the installer for a modlist to create them. 
The script deletes them after moving the archives.

The Unused Mods folder gets created in the same location as the script is in.
